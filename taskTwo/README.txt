Hello there! Thank you for taking a look to my code!
The solution is ready to run, but first an apologise:

* I have solved these tasks in C and not in Java because right now I know the basic of Java language but with some features I am not comfortable on yet so I could't solve all the tasks. I love coding and solve real problems with my thinking so I have written all the methods (functions) in C with all the functions necessary in order to test the code with the txt file in this folder. I hope you will take a look even though it is a quite long.

I am really sorry, but I wanted to solve all the task for this part in any way! *

Please follow the instructions below:
- download the data file at: https://drive.google.com/file/d1o92x6ariJijxjJxITNkZAxwhMYC8VYL3/view?usp=sharing
- make sure to put the .c file and the .txt file in the same directory
- for Mac users, the directory that I have written in the source code is good, but in other OS, to adjust this could be the only thing that you are asked to change
- compile (please write: clang / gcc taskTwo.c) the .c file (taskTwo.c) in the terminal
- run the compiled file (please write: ./a.out)
- enjoy the program!

-> the results that my program returns could be a bit different with those expected because I struggled quite a bit to convert the .cvs file in a .txt format.

Thank you for your time!
