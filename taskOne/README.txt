Hi there! 

*I am considering uppercase letters equal to their correspondent lowercase letter*

The code is ready to run! Please follow the instructions below:
- extract the zip folder
- put every file in the same directory
- compile the source code on the terminal
- execute the compiled file but remember to add after the run instruction the name of the sanction list (SanctionList.txt) separated with a blank space
- enjoy!

I have implemented also the case where the inputs are saved in a text file. In order to try this function the only thing you need to do is uncomment some lines:
- 43 <= line <= 50
- 80 <= line <= 94
- 129 <= line <= 139
- 143
- when executing the compiled file remember to add also the name of the input list (wordList.txt);

Please feel free to modify the inputs!

For any questions, you can write to me at kaiximatteo.chen@mail.polimi.it

Thank you for your time!
